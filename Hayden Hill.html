				<h3>About</h3>
				<p>Currently a senior at Madison Academic. I am 18 years old, a diligent student, and a competitive athlete. Over my High-School career, I took classes in web-design to further my knowledge on that subject. I also took AP Calculus because I know that is needed for a Computer Science degree. Next year, I will attend Rhodes College. At Rhodes, I will be involved in the ROTC program while majoring in Computer science and minoring in Military Science. I will also be swimming for the Rhodes Swim Team. Go Lynx!
